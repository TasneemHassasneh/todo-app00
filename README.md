# Todo List Manager App - Phase 1

## Overview

- **Purpose**: The "Todo List Manager" app helps users efficiently manage their daily tasks and to-do lists.
- **Features**: It allows users to add, view, and manage tasks, along with customization through configuration settings.
- **Technology**: The app is built with React and utilizes the React Context API for settings management.

## Key Functionality

1. **Task Management**: Users can add, view, and manage tasks with titles, descriptions, and details.

2. **Configuration Settings**: Users can customize how tasks are displayed, including:
   - Displaying a default of three tasks.
   - Hiding completed tasks by default.
   - Sorting tasks by "difficulty" by default.

3. **Pagination**: For managing large task lists, pagination allows users to navigate tasks efficiently.

## User Experience

- **Default Settings**: Users are presented with three incomplete tasks initially, with completed tasks hidden and sorted by "difficulty."

- **Customization**: Users can adjust settings to tailor their experience, including displaying more tasks, showing completed tasks, or changing sorting criteria.

- **Pagination**: When tasks exceed the screen limit, pagination facilitates navigation.

## Styling

- The app's user interface is styled using the Mantine Component API, aiming to match the provided design closely.

## Learning Objectives

- This project helps developers:
  - Gain proficiency in React and React Context functionality.
  - Improve documentation reading and implementation skills, especially for component libraries like Mantine.
  - Practice JavaScript array manipulation for pagination.
  - Develop React testing skills.

## Future Phases

- Phase 1 establishes the app's foundation. Future phases may include:
  - Editing and deleting tasks.
  - Search and filter options.
  - User authentication and individual task lists.
  - Enhanced styling to closely match the design.

## Conclusion

The "Todo List Manager" app in Phase 1 focuses on core functionality and configuration settings, providing a valuable tool for task management while enabling developers to learn and apply React and related technologies.
